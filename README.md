# Data-Mining
My work in the course Data Mining.

## Course Overview

This course covers advanced topics in data mining and machine learning, including various clustering techniques, classification methods, decision trees, and neural networks. It combines theoretical concepts with practical implementations and culminates in a two-part final project.
